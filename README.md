## Short Description of what the site is

This is an inventory management website for users to check their stocks of item and the deliveries they make which is connected to the database. All the datas loaded, added and deleted will be on and from the database. As database I have used MongoDB. And to connect with MongoDB I have used NodeJS as my backend.
